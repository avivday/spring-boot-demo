# Java Spring Boot Skeleton
## N-tier layered architecture using DI and best practices

## Includes:
- n-tier layers: Models, Dao, Service & Web API as default layers.
- Dao & Services exposed using interfaces, keeping everything decoupled and clean.
- Mocking for DAO
- application.properties to control each dao (choose mock or real for each data source you have)
- Unit testing against mock

## TODO:
- Add swagger
- Security headers
- Integration Tests
